-Image Specifications-

These images conform to the TCL image format.  This format is not
supported by most image processing software, so to import the images into
your particular package, you need to know that they have a 512 byte header
and are all 512 by 382 pixels in size (EXCEPT for LAMP2 images 1-37 which
are 512 by 512).  Each pixel is stored as a 16 bit quantity. 

All images in this collection have been processed as follows: 1) The
original three-image stacks have been numerically deconvolved using the
nearest neighbor algorithm.  2) They have been cropped so that there is
one cell per image, and 3) all pixels outside this crop region have been
set to 0. If you need the raw, unprocesssed images for some reason, please
contact us (murphy@cmu.edu).

When used for pattern recognition purposes in (1), the five image
classes were split as follows for training and testing.
